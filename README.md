# Applets for Pipewire

A few small applets for Pipewire, to help with wiring.  Rather good to use these with [Helvum](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/helvum) for visualization.

## pw-savewires <filename.csv>

Saves existing Pipewire wiring, in filename.csv, for future use.

## pw-loadwires <filename.csv>

Loads a set of Pipewire wiring, as saved by pw-savewires, from filename.csv.

## pw-dewire

Removes all currently active Pipewire wiring.
